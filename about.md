Hello there, random internet visitor!

I'm Peter and I live in Czech Republic (Europe). At the present time, I'm a Computer Science student at Czech Technical University and Charles University (that's right - I study two colleges at the same time).

Since my teenage years I've had this hobby of creating and designing computer stuff other people could use. I've pursued this hobby of mine so relentlessly it became my main occupation today.

My professional experience includes blogs, webzines, e-commerce sites, but also few startups, enterprise cloud systems and smartphone apps. I code mainly on the .NET platform but I also know a little of C++, PHP and Objective-C. I have quite deep understanding of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript including all the commonly used techniques and frameworks like jQuery, LESS, etc.

If you're interested in doing something together, feel free to contact me. We can surely work something out. My current resume is available [online at LinkedIn.com][linked-in].

That's all, folks!
